main points:
- probabilistic computation is a very convenient way of describing a
  variety of information security issues
  > two primitives: probabilistic interpretation, probabilistic inference
- knowledge tracking summary
  > 
- progression of information flow
  > information flow: does information flow ?
  > quantified information flow: how much information flows ?
  > semantic information flow: what information flows ?

- exploiting models of knowledge
  > auditing
  > policy enforcement
    . simulatable auditing
    . blacklist functions
  > queries on existing knowledge
- problems
  > approximate inference
    . sound approximation
  > initial belief
    . model learner from public statistics
    . which model?
